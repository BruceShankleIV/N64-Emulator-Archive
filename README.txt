This archive is not to include front-ends for other emulators like Parallel Launcher or Rosalie's Mupen GUI (Graphical User Interface),
as semantically, these kinds of programs are not emulators themselves but serve as a external program to an existing emulation project.

Additionally, if you have come here looking to download an N64 emulator, try Project64 1.6.2 WIP 9 (when it's ready) if you do not care
about accuracy to N64 hardware limitations, use Ares otherwise. For SM64 TAS, Mupen64 rerecording v8 is found in the Vulnerable folder.
