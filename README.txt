This archive is not to include front-ends for other emulators like Parallel Launcher or Rosalie's Mupen GUI (Graphical User Interface),
as these kinds of programs are semantically not emulators themselves but serve as an external program to an existing emulation project.

Additionally, if you have come here looking to download an N64 emulator, try the latest WIP of my Project64 1.6.2 emu if you don't care
about accuracy to N64 hardware limitations, use Ares otherwise. Mupen64 rerecording v8 is found in the OLD AS HECK folder for SM64 TAS.
